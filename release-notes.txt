OpenMDAO Version 1.7.1 Alpha Release Notes
July 18, 2016

Features:

June 30, 2016

Backwards-Incompatible Change:
  1. 'fd_options' is now 'deriv_options' in systems.
  2. New 'type' option allows the user to select between analytic, finite difference, or complex step.
  3. The 'force_fd' option is no longer needed because of type.

  7. Old code will still work, but will raise deprecation warnings.

Features:

* The output of check_partial_derivatives has been modified so that absolute or
  relative errors that exceed a tolerance are flagged with a '*'.
  The tolerances can be specified via call arguments.
* User can now specify a scaler on any residual by specifying a resid_scaler during add_state.
  OpenMDAO see the residual divided by this number.

* Setup messages, warnings, and errors are now all delayed and given all that the same time, at the end of setup.
* Components can now raise AnalysisError when a component fails to have solver or driver handle the situation cleanly. Note: solvers and drivers need to be written to handle this correctly
* Systems (Groups & Components) will set a _jacobian_changed flag, so that solver can know if they need to do some extra work.
* Pyoptsparse Driver will catch AnalysisError and pass fail-flag to pyopt-sparse.
* Added error msg to top of run and run_once in case force_fd is changed from its setting pre-setup.
* User can call list_params method on a group to get a list of all the parameters that don't have any src at that level of the hierarchy.
* Add a test support utility function to check for the presence of fd_options['force_fd']=True in a group.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.6.0 Alpha Release Notes
March 1, 2016

Backwards-Incompatible Change

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.4.1 Alpha Release Notes
November 24, 2015

Features
* User now gets an error if passing "promotes" keyword arg into any system.  Should help reduce
confusion when making models.
* Newton Solver will respect state variable bounds.

Bugfixes
* The original check to see if a linear solver with maxiter>1 was needed was too strict
in some cases where a component had states.  If a component defines its own solve_linear method
then an iterative solver isn't needed, even if the component has states.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.4.0 Alpha Release Notes
November 18, 2015

API Change
* When using 'add_desvar' and 'add_constraint', there were inconsistent names for setting
bounds.  (low, high vs. lower, upper), which was becoming confusing to users.  The new
standard is that all are consistently set using "lower" and "upper", and the others are deprecated.

Default Setting Changes
* Recording option 'record_metadata' now defaults to True for all recorders except CSVRecorder.
* The default linear solver will now be LinearGaussSeidel.

Features

* Added a new real-world example problem (beam-sizing) in the User Guide's Tutorials section.
* Recorders now have an option to turn off recording of Params, Unknowns, Resids.
* Recorders now include metadata for objectives, design variables, and constraints.

  do this by calling 'print_all_convergence' on a problem after calling setup.
* Users now receive a check_setup warning about any scalar integer variable or any list value.

Bugfixes
* Added a much more descriptive error message if a Jacobian item is the incorrect size.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.3.0 Alpha Release Notes
November 4, 2015

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.2.0 Alpha Release Notes
October 15, 2015

API Change
*The way imports work in OpenMDAO has changed.  Importing things from their parent module
no longer works.  Importing things directly from their source files still works.
A new namespace, "openmdao.api" has been created, from which you can import anything
you previously got from a module file.

Examples:
#Example 1:  old way, import from module, no longer supported
from openmdao.core import Component, Group
from openmdao.components import IndepVarComp
from openmdao.solvers import ScipyGMRES

#Example 2: directly from source file (still works), to do same as Ex 1.
from openmdao.core.component import Component
from openmdao.core.group import Group
from openmdao.components.indep_var_comp import IndepVarComp
from openmdao.solvers.scipy_gmres import ScipyGMRES

#Example 3: new way using openmdao.api, to do same as Ex 1.
from openmdao.api import Component, Group, IndepVarComp, ScipyGMRES

As always, even though we are still in alpha, we apologize if our API changes
cause any problems.  Feel free to ask questions on our StackOverflow tag if you
experience any difficulties.


Features
* Users can solve for derivatives with a LinGS solver
* check_partial_derivatives now loops over all variables in a component.
* Updated many docstrings and the generate_docstring function to include options.

* Fixed small bug in setup's reporting of unit conversions.
* Fixed bug regarding Jacobian size disagreement in brachistochrone_slsqp problem.
* Fixed a bug with scaler and adder in pyoptsparse_driver.
* Fixed a bug in Jacobian sizing

  respect to the design vars.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.1.1 Alpha Release Notes
September 22, 2015

* Fixed a problem with a missing dependency for our documentation build on openmdao.readthedocs.org

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenMDAO Version 1.1.0 Alpha Release Notes
September 22, 2015

API Changes
* Renamed 'ParamComp' to 'IndepVarComp,'' because it’s really just a component that
supplies one or more independent variables as outputs, and it has no parameters. And
overuse of term 'param' may have been causing confusion.

* Changed the names of some Driver methods, replacing 'param' with
'desvar,' which is short for ‘design variable’.  So 'set_param' is now
'set_desvar,' 'get_params' is now 'get_desvars,' and 'add_param' is now 'add_desvar.'

* ConstraintComp is going away, but user can add constraints directly to an optimizer
 via driver.add_constraint(‘<var_name>’, lower=xxx, upper=xxx, equals=xxxx)


Features
* Multiple documentation changes and fixes, including:
    - an example for running check_partial_derivatives,
    - an MPI parallelization tutorial,
    - ExecComp example that shows how to handle array vars,
    - better auto-documentation of our components/drivers (now including Options).
* User can solve for derivatives with a Petsc KSP solver.
* User can now create a recorder using SQLlite as the db w/shelve API.
* GMRES linear solver now uses solve_linear method for preconditioning.
* Added iprint output to all the linear and nonlinear solvers.
* Convert CADRE problem for use with the Alpha, including Linear Gauss-Seidel.
* Added support for distributed components.
* Added Surrogate Generators
* Further work on parallel, incuding:
    - Got parallel working with petsc 3.6.
    - Got parallel derivs in adjoint when voi are under parallel goups
    - Get gradient calculation working for constraints that live in (or below) parallel systems under MPI.


Bugfixes:
* Fixed bug where derivative calculation breaks when a parameter sub_slice is added to a driver.
* pyoptsparse now works with Python 3.4.x
* Made dump recorder work in parallel for CADRE. Also, updated drivers so that all obj/cons are gathered by the time we record.
* When calling group.subsystems with local=True, execution order of systems is now preserved.
* User now gets a clearer error about petscImpl if they try to run under MPI without the petsc_impl
* ExecComp now raises an exception if any of the kwargs passed to init are not variables found in the ExecComp equations.
* Driver.set_param no longer ignores 'indices' metadata.
* Promotion of a non-existent variable now provides full path name in the error message.
