OpenMDAO Version 1.3.0 Alpha Release Notes
November 4, 2015

API Change
* The name `jacobian` has been changed everywhere to the clearer, more descriptive,
more correct `linearize`.  Use of `jacobian` is deprecated, please change your files
accordingly.

Features
* Added some explanatory animations to the Basics section of the User Guide.
* Users can now finite difference in parallel for derivatives.
* Improved warning/error system for connected input problems.
* Added ability to capture variable metadata to recorders.
* User can now set fd mode to complex_step for fd_jacobian method on component.
* Added new option to recorders to specify to not save Params, Unknowns, Resids.

Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug in sparse Jacobian so that it no longer computes nor creates knowably zero entries.
* Fixed some documentation errors in the recorder tutorial.
* Fixed a bug wherein unknown values were not updated when using Python 3.x
* Created a more descriptive error message for a user trying to access a variable
    unavailable in the current process.
* Components now required to properly initialize their outputs.

OpenMDAO Version 1.2.0 Alpha Release Notes
October 15, 2015

API Change
*The way imports work in OpenMDAO has changed.  Importing things from their parent module
no longer works.  Importing things directly from their source files still works.
A new namespace, "openmdao.api" has been created, from which you can import anything
you previously got from a module file.

Examples:
#Example 1:  old way, import from module, no longer supported
from openmdao.core import Component, Group
from openmdao.components import IndepVarComp
from openmdao.solvers import ScipyGMRES

#Example 2: directly from source file (still works), to do same as Ex 1.
from openmdao.core.component import Component
from openmdao.core.group import Group
from openmdao.components.indep_var_comp import IndepVarComp
from openmdao.solvers.scipy_gmres import ScipyGMRES

#Example 3: new way using openmdao.api, to do same as Ex 1.
from openmdao.api import Component, Group, IndepVarComp, ScipyGMRES

As always, even though we are still in alpha, we apologize if our API changes
cause any problems.  Feel free to ask questions on our StackOverflow tag if you
experience any difficulties.


Features
* Users can solve for derivatives with a LinGS solver
* check_partial_derivatives now loops over all variables in a component.
* Updated many docstrings and the generate_docstring function to include options.


Bugfixes
* Fixed precedence for fd settings in check_partial_derivatives.
* Fixed small bug in setup's reporting of unit conversions.
* Fixed bug regarding Jacobian size disagreement in brachistochrone_slsqp problem.
* Fixed a bug with scaler and adder in pyoptsparse_driver.
* Fixed a bug in Jacobian sizing
* Fix so the Jacobian returned to pyoptsparse reflects sparsity of constraints with
  respect to the design vars.

* Fixed a problem with a missing dependency for our documentation build on openmdao.readthedocs.org

OpenMDAO Version 1.1.0 Alpha Release Notes
September 22, 2015

API Changes
* Renamed 'ParamComp' to 'IndepVarComp,'' because it’s really just a component that
supplies one or more independent variables as outputs, and it has no parameters. And
overuse of term 'param' may have been causing confusion.

* Changed the names of some Driver methods, replacing 'param' with
'desvar,' which is short for ‘design variable’.  So 'set_param' is now
'set_desvar,' 'get_params' is now 'get_desvars,' and 'add_param' is now 'add_desvar.'

* ConstraintComp is going away, but user can add constraints directly to an optimizer
 via driver.add_constraint(‘<var_name>’, lower=xxx, upper=xxx, equals=xxxx)


Features
* Multiple documentation changes and fixes, including:
    - an example for running check_partial_derivatives,
    - an MPI parallelization tutorial,
    - ExecComp example that shows how to handle array vars,
    - better auto-documentation of our components/drivers (now including Options).
* User can solve for derivatives with a Petsc KSP solver.
* User can now create a recorder using SQLlite as the db w/shelve API.
* GMRES linear solver now uses solve_linear method for preconditioning.
* Added iprint output to all the linear and nonlinear solvers.
* Convert CADRE problem for use with the Alpha, including Linear Gauss-Seidel.
* Added support for distributed components.
* Added Surrogate Generators
* Further work on parallel, incuding:
    - Got parallel working with petsc 3.6.
    - Got parallel derivs in adjoint when voi are under parallel goups
    - Get gradient calculation working for constraints that live in (or below) parallel systems under MPI.


Bugfixes:
* Fixed bug where derivative calculation breaks when a parameter sub_slice is added to a driver.
* pyoptsparse now works with Python 3.4.x
* Made dump recorder work in parallel for CADRE. Also, updated drivers so that all obj/cons are gathered by the time we record.
* When calling group.subsystems with local=True, execution order of systems is now preserved.
* User now gets a clearer error about petscImpl if they try to run under MPI without the petsc_impl
* ExecComp now raises an exception if any of the kwargs passed to init are not variables found in the ExecComp equations.
* Driver.set_param no longer ignores 'indices' metadata.
* Promotion of a non-existent variable now provides full path name in the error message.
* Fixed a bug in reverse mode when using apply_linear
* Now skips tests (instead of failing) in test_mpi_derivs.py if petsc4py is not installed on host system.

OpenMDAO Version 1.0.4 Alhpa Release Notes
August 12, 2015

Features:

OpenMDAO Version 1.0 Alpha Release Notes
July 20, 2015

Initial Release

Differences from previous code base:
* 10x smaller code base (~5000 lines of code compared to ~50,000 before)
* Compatible with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.4+
* Install using pip, just like any other Python package
* No more Traits dependency, and no more weird class-like variable definitions anymore!
* Ability to manually group components to be finite-differenced together
* No more dataflow/workflow duality. Now you just define a single model hierarchy
* No more Assembly overhead. Grouping components no longer introduces any inefficiencies
* Parallel execution (and parallel adjoint derivatives) with an MPI distributed-memory data passing system

Install: http://openmdao.org/docs/getting-started/install.html
