.. index:: Serial and Parallel Multi-Point Example

.. note::

  **Requirements**

  This example runs OpenMDAO in parallel which requires `petsc4py` and `mpi4py`.
  You must have these packages installed in order to proceed.
  To get these packages set up on Linux, see `MPI on Linux`_.
  To get these packages set up on Windows, see `MPI on Windows`_.

Setting Up Serial Multi-Point Problems
----------------------------------------
A multi-point problem is when you want to analyze a single design at a number
of different conditions. For example, you might model aircraft performance at
five different flight conditions or predict solar power generation at ten
different times of the year. One approach to capture this kind of problem
structure is to define a `Group` that models your design, then stamp out as many
copies as you need.  This approach can use a large amount of memory, depending
on the size of your model and the number of copies you make, but it has the
advantage of supporting the calculation of derivatives across the entire
multi-point group.

Running Multi-Point in Parallel
-------------------------------

In many multi-point problems, all of the points can be run independently of
each other, which provides an opportunity to run things in parallel. Your serial
multi-point problem needs only a few minor modifications in order to run in parallel.

.. note::

     You'll need to make sure you have mpi, mpi4py, petsc, and petsc4py installed
     in order to do anything in parallel.

All of the changes you're going to make are in the run-script itself.
No changes are needed to the `Component` or `Group` classes.
You'll need to import the PETSc based data passing implementation,
and then to avoid getting a lot of extra print-out use a small
helper function that only prints on the rank 0 processor.
We also turned off the check-setup just to avoid getting
lots of extra output to the screen.

.. code-block:: python


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        from openmdao.api import Problem

        from openmdao.core.mpi_wrap import MPI

        if MPI: # pragma: no cover
            # if you called this script with 'mpirun', then use the
            # petsc data passing
            from openmdao.core.petsc_impl import PetscImpl as impl
        else:
            # if you didn't use `mpirun`, then use the numpy data passing
            from openmdao.api import BasicImpl as impl

        def mpi_print(prob, *args):
            """ helper function to only print on rank 0"""
            if prob.root.comm.rank == 0:
                print(*args)

        prob = Problem(impl=impl) #set the implementation

        size = 10 #number of points

        adders = np.arange(size)/10.
        scalars = np.arange(size, 2*size)/10.

        prob.root = ParallelMultiPoint(adders, scalars)

        #turning off setup checking to avoid getting 10 sets of printouts to the screen
        prob.setup(check=False)

        st = time.time()

        prob['x'] = np.ones(size) * 0.7
        st = time.time()
        mpi_print(prob, "run started")
        prob.run()
        mpi_print(prob, "run finished", time.time() - st)

        mpi_print(prob, prob['aggregate.total'])


You can save the new run-script to a second file, called
*parallel_multi_point.py* Then you run this code,
and you should see a significant reduction in the run-time.


::

    mpirun -n 10 python parallel_multi_point.py

We have to allocate 10 processes, because we have 10 points in `ParallelGroup`.
