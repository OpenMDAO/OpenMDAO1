This document provides a brief overview of the core concepts and constructs
involved in defining and solving a problem using OpenMDAO. We start
by explaining the `System`, which forms the mathematical foundation of OpenMDAO,
then discuss how `System` relates to `Component` and `Group`. `Component` is the
computational class of OpenMDAO, where you build models and wrap external analysis codes.
`Group` represents collections of `Components` and other `Groups` with data passing
and an execution sequence. Lastly we discuss `Problem`, which serves as the container
for your whole model.


System
------

OpenMDAO uses a unique abstraction for representing large models of coupled systems,
based on the Modular Analysis and Unified Derivatives ([MAUD]_) mathematical architecture
developed by Hwang and Martins. The fundamental concept in MAUD is that an entire
system model can be represented as a hierarchical set of systems of non-linear equations.

.. [MAUD] Hwang, J. T., A modular approach to large-scale design

   2015. `Thesis pdf. <http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/sites/default/files/Hwang_dissertation.pdf>`_ (168 pages)

Hence the most basic building block in OpenMDAO is the `System` class.
This class represents a system of equations that need to be solved together
so that a single solution satisfies them all.

A system of equations is specified by one or more parameters (input values) and
one or more unknowns (output values). For example, a really simple
explicit system may contain only a single equation, such as:

::

    y = x**2 + 2

For this system, *x* is the parameter (input variable) and *y* is the unknown
(output variable). Implicit equations, where you vary a state value to drive
a residual to 0, can also be part of a system. The above equation could be restated
implicitly as:

::

    R(y) = x**2 + 2 - y = 0

There is now a corresponding residual value for *y* as well.
The `System` class has *params*, *unknowns*, and *resids* attributes
that store the lists of parameters and unknowns as vectors for efficient processing.

.. Note::

  Unknowns come in two flavors: *outputs* are computed by explicit equations.
  *states* are unknowns that are varied to drive residuals to 0.


The equations themselves are encapsulated in a member function of the `System`
class called *solve_nonlinear*. For explicit equations *solve_nonlinear* will compute
the unknown values for the given parameter values and put them into the unknown vector.
For implicit relationships, *solve_nonlinear* will find the correct values for the state
variables that converge the residuals. A second function, *apply_nonlinear*,
is used to compute the residual values for a given state value (it does not
fully converge the system of equations). *apply_nonlinear* is not used if you
have only explicit equations.

There are a few other attributes and member functions in the `System` interface,
mostly related to calculating derivatives and supporting more complex systems,
but this is the essential base abstraction.

There are two subclasses of `System` that are used to actually build a model
They are the `Component` class and the `Group` class.

Component
---------

The `Component` class is the lowest level system in OpenMDAO. Child classes of
`Component` are the only classes allowed to create parameter, output, and state
variables. By sub-classing `Component` and defining a *solve_nonlinear* (and
*apply_nonlinear* if state variables are present), users can build their own
models or implement wrappers for existing analysis codes.

Variables are added to the class in the constructor (*__init__* method) via the
*add_parameter*, *add_output* and *add_state* functions. For example:

::

    class MyComp(Component):
        def __init__(self):
            super(MyComp, self).__init__()
            self.add_param('x', val=0.)
            self.add_output('y', shape=1)
            self.add_state('z', val=[0., 1.])

.. note::

    Initial values (or shape and type) are required when adding variables to a
    component in order to allocate the needed space in the vectors for data
    passing. If only a shape is given, the type is assumed to be *float* if
    shape is 1 and a numpy float array if shape has any other value.

The *solve_nonlinear* function takes three arguments: the parameters vector, the
unknowns vector, and a residuals vector. This function will be called using the
vector attributes of the `Component` instance, so those vectors will
contain entries for the variables declared in the constructor. For example:

::

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            unknowns['y'] = params['x']**2 + 2

When implicit equations are involved, the *apply_nonlinear* method must be implemented.
This function is written to compute the residual values for whatever values of the parameters
and state variables are given. The user must then decide how the implicit equations should
be converged. There are two choices:

  #. Use an OpenMDAO solver
  #. Have the component converge itself

We'll talk more about solvers in later docs, but if you go this route then you can
stop at *apply_nonlinear*. But if you would like a component with state variables to
converge itself, you will also define the *solve_nonlinear* method.

::

  def apply_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):
      resids['y'] = params['x']**2 + 2 - unknowns['y']

  def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):
      """
      Only used if the component is able to converge its
      own residuals
      """
      while abs(resids['y']) > 1e-5:
        self.apply_nonlinear(params, unknowns, resids)
        unknowns['y'] += resids['y']


Component Derivatives
----------------------
If you want to define analytic derivatives for your components, to help make your
optimizations faster and more accurate, then your component will also define
a *linearize* method, that linearizes the non-linear equations and provides the
partial derivatives (derivatives of unknowns w.r.t parameters for a single component)
to the framework.

::

  def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
      J = {}
      J['y','x'] = 2*params['x']
      J['y','y'] = 1

.. note::

  When you're providing derivatives for implicit equations, you give derivatives
  of the residual with respect to the params and state variables: ('y','x') and
  ('y','y')


Group
------
`Group` is used to build a complex model out of smaller sub-system building
blocks, which may be instances of either `Component` or `Group`. So a `Group`
is just a `System` composed of the equations from its children that are coupled
together via data connections. Because groups can contain other groups, they
form a hierarchy that defines the organizational structure of your model.

A `Group` is created simply by adding one or more `Systems`.
For example, we can add a `Group` to another `Group` along with some `Components`:

::

    c1 = MyComp()
    c2 = MyComp()
    c3 = MyComp()

    g1 = Group()
    g1.add('comp1', c1)
    g1.add('comp2', c2)

    g2 = Group()
    g2.add('comp3', c3)
    g2.add('sub_group_1', g1)

Interdependencies between `Systems` in a `Group` are represented as connections
between the variables in the `Group`'s subsystems.  Connections can be made
either explicitly or implicitly.

An explicit connection is made from the output (or state) of one `System` to the input
(parameter) of another using the `Group` *connect* method, as follows:

::

    g2.sub_group_1.connect('comp1.y', 'comp2.x')

.. |playbutton2|  image:: ../_images/blueplaybutton.png
    :height: 20px
    :target: http://openmdao.org/images/ExplicitConnection_animated.gif

Alternatively, you can use the *promotion* mechanism to implicitly connect two
or more variables.  When a `System` is added to a `Group`, you may optionally
specify a list of variable names that are to be *promoted* from the subsystem
to the group level. This means that you can reference the variable as if it
were a variable of the `Group` rather than the subsystem.  For Example:

::

    g2.add("comp3", c3, promotes=['x'])

Now you can access the parameter 'x' from 'c3' as if it were a variable of
the group: 'g2.x'. If you promote multiple subsystem variables with the same
name, then those variables will be implicitly connected:

::

    g2.add("sub_group_1", g1, promotes=['comp1.x'])

Now setting a value for 'g2.x' will set the value for both 'c3.x' and 'g1.c1.x'
and they are said to be implicitly connected.  If you promote the output from
one subsystem and the input of another with the same name, then that will have
the same effect as the explicit connection statement as shown above.

In contrast to a `Component`, which is responsible for defining the variables
and equations that map between them, a `Group` has the responsibility of assembling
multiple systems of equations and solving them together. A `Group` uses
a `Solver` to solve the collection of `Components` as a whole. In fact, a `Group`
has two associated solvers: a linear solver and a non-linear solver.  The
default linear solver is SciPy's GMres and the default non-linear solver is a
simple `RunOnce` solver that will just call the solve_non_linear method on each
system in the `Group` sequentially. A number of other iterative solvers, both linear and
non-linear, are available that can be substituted for the defaults.


Problem
-------

When a model has been fully developed as a `Group` with a collection of
`Components` and sub-`Groups` it is time to actually do something with it
(e.g. run an analysis, design of experiments, or optimization).
This is done by defining a single top level object, a `Problem` instance,
that contains your model.

A `Problem` always has a single top-level `Group` called *root*.  This can
be passed in the constructor or set later:

::

    prob = Problem(ExampleGroup())

    or

    root = ExampleGroup()
    prob = Problem(root)

A `Problem` also has a driver, which "drives" or controls the solution of
the `Problem`. The base `Driver` class in OpenMDAO is the simplest driver
possible, which just calls *solve_nonlinear* on the *root* `Group`. This
simple driver may be replaced with more interesting types like optimization,
case iteration, and design of experiment drivers. Essentially, the `Driver`
determines how the `Problem` will execute your model.

The `Driver` is invoked by calling the *run* method on the `Problem`. Prior
to doing that, however, you must perform *setup*.  This function does all
the necessary initialization of the data vectors and configuration for the
data transfers that must occur during execution. It will also look for and
report any potential issues with the `Problem` configuration, including
unconnected parameters, conflicting units, etc.

Summary
-------

The general procedure for defining and solving a `Problem` in OpenMDAO is:
    - define `Components` (including their *solve_nonlinear* and optional *linearize* functions)
    - assemble `Components` into Groups and make connections (explicitly or implicitly)
    - instantiate a `Problem` with the *root* `Group`
    - perform *setup* on the `Problem` to initialize all vectors and data transfers
    - perform *run* on the Problem

A very basic example of defining and running a `Problem` with a custom `Component` is shown below.
This example makes use of the convenience component `IndepVarComp` to provide a source for the
input parameter to the custom `MultiplyByTwoComponent`.

.. testcode:: basics

    from __future__ import print_function

    from openmdao.api import Group, Problem, Component, IndepVarComp

    class MultiplyByTwoComponent(Component):
        def __init__(self):
            super(MultiplyByTwoComponent, self).__init__() # always call the base class constructor first
            self.add_param('x_input', val=0.) # the input that will be multiplied by 2
            self.add_output('y_output', shape=1) # shape=1 => a one dimensional array of length 1 (a scalar)

            # an internal variable that counts the number of times this component was executed
            self.counter = 0

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            unknowns['y_output'] = params['x_input']*2
            self.counter += 1

    root = Group()
    root.add('indep_var', IndepVarComp('x', 7.0))
    root.add('my_comp', MultiplyByTwoComponent())
    root.connect('indep_var.x', 'my_comp.x_input')

    prob = Problem(root)
    prob.setup()
    prob.run()

    result = prob['my_comp.y_output']
    count = prob.root.my_comp.counter
    print(result)
    print(count)

Running this example produces the output:
