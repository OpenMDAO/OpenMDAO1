DoE Drivers
===========

Drivers that run a design of experiments (DoE) all inherit from the
`PredeterminedRunsDriver` class.  Some examples are `FullFactorialDriver`,
`UniformDriver`, and the subject of this tutorial, `OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver`.

The Latin Hypercube Driver
--------------------------

The Latin Hypercube (LHC) method of randomization
generates samples across an entire range of desired design variables.
The Optimized Latin Hypercube (OLHC) is an improvement on the LHC method in which
samples generated by the LHC are adjusted to ensure an expansive distribution.

Below is an example using the component from the :ref:`paraboloid_tutorial`.
::

    from openmdao.api import IndepVarComp, Group, Problem, ScipyOptimizer, ExecComp, DumpRecorder
    from openmdao.test.paraboloid import Paraboloid

    from openmdao.drivers.latinhypercube_driver import OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver

    top = Problem()
    root = top.root = Group()

    root.add('p1', IndepVarComp('x', 50.0), promotes=['*'])
    root.add('p2', IndepVarComp('y', 50.0), promotes=['*'])
    root.add('comp', Paraboloid(), promotes=['*'])

    top.driver = OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver(num_samples=4, seed=0, population=20, generations=4, norm_method=2)
    top.driver.add_desvar('x', lower=-50.0, upper=50.0)
    top.driver.add_desvar('y', lower=-50.0, upper=50.0)

    top.driver.add_objective('f_xy')

    recorder = DumpRecorder('paraboloid')
    recorder.options['record_params'] = True
    recorder.options['record_unknowns'] = False
    recorder.options['record_resids'] = False
    top.driver.add_recorder(recorder)

    top.setup()
    top.run()

    top.cleanup()


Here we will explain the code statements that pertain to using an Optimized
Latin Hypercube (OLHC).

::

    from openmdao.drivers.latinhypercube_driver import OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver

In order to setup a model to utilize the OLHC, we need to import
`OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver`.

::

    root.add('p1', IndepVarComp('x', 50.0), promotes=['*'])
    root.add('p2', IndepVarComp('y', 50.0), promotes=['*'])
    root.add('comp', Paraboloid(), promotes=['*'])

By promoting the variables x and y to the group level, no *connect* statement is
needed for the paraboloid component to receive these as input variables.
Similarly, when we define the OLHC design variables, we can simply call the
same *x* and *y* without any additional code.

The next three lines will initialize and add design variables to the OLHC.

::

    top.driver = OptimizedLatinHypercubeDriver(num_samples=4, seed=0, population=20, generations=4, norm_method=2)
    top.driver.add_desvar('x', lower=-50.0, upper=50.0)
    top.driver.add_desvar('y', lower=-50.0, upper=50.0)

The first line initializes the driver. The 'num_samples' argument determines how
many samples each design variable will cycle through. By default, the 'seed'
argument itself is a random value. However, by choosing a seed value, we can
easily duplicate a sample set for a repeatable testing environment.

The next two lines define the ranges of the design variables on which the OLHC
will operate.

Now we are ready to record data. The four intervals of [-50, 50) are: [-50,-25),
[-25,0), [0,25), [25,50).  The LHC will ensure there is an *x* and *y* value in
each interval.

The recorded output is shown below. It's been filtered to show only the
generated input values.
::

    Timestamp: 1446745425.935
    Iteration Coordinate: Driver/0
    Params:
      comp.x: -34.5655676503
      comp.y: -37.7665306197
    Timestamp: 1446745425.936
    Iteration Coordinate: Driver/0
    Params:
      comp.x: 47.7779475273
      comp.y: 14.7245403548
    Timestamp: 1446745425.936
    Iteration Coordinate: Driver/0
    Params:
      comp.x: -7.77803623101
      comp.y: 34.1373674836
    Timestamp: 1446745425.936
    Iteration Coordinate: Driver/0
    Params:
      comp.x: 1.49637359158
      comp.y: -14.9422886231

As you can see, there is an 'x' and 'y' value in each interval. The OLHC was
able to set up 3 of the 4 input combinations to be in different intervals from
each other, ensuring better coverage of the parameter space.

.. _doe_driver_parallel:

Running a DOE Driver in Parallel
--------------------------------

All drivers inheriting from `PredeterminedRunsDriver` take an initialization
argument named *num_par_doe*.  This is used to specify the desired number of
DOEs to be performed concurrently.  The default value is 1, but if you have
MPI and petsc installed, you can set it to higher values and run your model
in parallel using *mpirun*.  To learn how to properly install all of the
dependencies needed to run in parallel, see `MPI on Linux`_ or
`MPI on Windows`_.
