Beam Sizing Problem - Intermediate Complexity Optimization Problem
==================================================================

Story Problem
------------------
George is building a one-story room addition with a basement onto his house. He is looking to maximize square footage while at the same time meeting his requirements.  The addition will have a full basement, and George hates support columns in the middle of his basement.  Therefore, George wants to buy a single beam (girder) that will run across the length of his basement down the middle and only be supported on the ends.  The beam will be used to support the floor joists.  George’s basement will be 8 feet tall, but the beam height will intrude into that space.  Therefore, George has decided that he doesn’t want a beam taller than 8 inches.  The beam will only support the weights imposed by the single floor, and not the weight of the walls and roof.  George has consulted his local building codes and found that a floor must be able to support up to 20psf dead load (furniture, bookshelves, carpet, etc) and up to a 40psf live load (people walking around).  George knows that this will be his party room with people jumping around, so George plays it safe and assumes 20psf dead load and 50psf live load (70psf total load).  George also consulted his building codes on floor deflection and learned that the floor must not deflect downward more than 1 unit for every 360 unit lengths spanned (a rating of L/360).  George knows that this building code minimum will be safe but will result in a very bouncy floor.  George hates bouncy floors and has decided to design for a deflection rating of at least L/720.  George also wants the length of the room to be greater than or equal to the width of the room.

George knows that the best way to meet his requirements will be to choose a steel wide flange beam.  George called his local steel retailer and found that the largest, heaviest, and strongest 8 inch beam they sell is a W8x58 beam, meaning that it is about 8 inches high and weighs 58 pounds per foot length.

- Beam will only be supported at the two ends.
- Achieve a deflection rating of at least L/720.
- Make sure beam safely satisfies bending stress requirements.

Constants
---------------
The constants used in this tutorial are:

.. testcode:: Beam

    from openmdao.api import Problem, ScipyOptimizer, Component, IndepVarComp, Group

    E = 29000000 #modulus of elasticity (constant 29000000psi for ASTM A992 Grade 50 steel)
    I = 228 #Ix = moment of Inertia (constant 228in4 for the W8x58 beam)
    BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN = 58.0 / 12.0 #self weight of beam per unit length (58 lbs/ft or 4.83 lbs/in.)
    DEAD_LOAD_PSI = 20.0 / 144 #The dead load is 20psf or 0.1389psi.
    LIVE_LOAD_PSI = 50.0 / 144 #The live load is 50psf or 0.3472psi.
    TOTAL_LOAD_PSI = DEAD_LOAD_PSI + LIVE_LOAD_PSI #total load
    BEAM_HEIGHT_IN = 8.75 #inches
    YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI = 50000 #The maximum yield strength Fy for ASTM A992 Grade 50 steel is 50,000 psi
    CROSS_SECTIONAL_AREA_SQIN = 17.1 #sq in

Room Area Component
----------------------
We want to maximize room area.  Room area is given by the following equation.

.. math::
    \mathrm{room\_area} = \mathrm{room\_length} * \mathrm{room\_width}

However, in OpenMDAO, problems must be written as a minimization problem.  The best way to do that is to negate the equation.  Therefore, we want to minimize neg_room_area such that

.. math::
    \mathrm{neg\_room\_area} = -(\mathrm{room\_length} * \mathrm{room\_width})
    :label: neg_room_area

Now we can find our derivatives:

.. math::
    \frac{d \mathrm{neg\_room\_area}} {d \mathrm{room\_width}} = -\mathrm{room\_length}

    \frac{d \mathrm{neg\_room\_area}} {d \mathrm{room\_length}} = -\mathrm{room\_width}

Now we can take this equation and create a `Component` called `NegativeArea`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class NegativeArea(Component):

        def __init__(self):
            super(NegativeArea, self).__init__()

            self.add_param('room_width', val=0.0)
            self.add_param('room_length', val=0.0)
            self.add_output('neg_room_area', val=0.0)

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            unknowns['neg_room_area'] = -(room_length * room_width)

        def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            J = {}

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            J['neg_room_area','room_width'] = -room_length
            J['neg_room_area','room_length'] = -room_width

            return J

Room Length and Width Component
-----------------------------------
George wants the length of the room to be at least the width of the room, given by the following equation.

.. math::
    \mathrm{room\_length} \geq \mathrm{room\_width}

If we create a variable called `length_minus_width`, we can constrain it to be greater than or equal to zero.

.. math::
    \mathrm{length\_minus\_width} = \mathrm{room\_length} - \mathrm{room\_width} \geq 0
    :label: length_minus_width

Now we can find our derivatives:

.. math::
    \frac{d \mathrm{length\_minus\_width}} {d \mathrm{room\_width}} = -1

    \frac{d \mathrm{length\_minus\_width}} {d \mathrm{room\_length}} = 1

Now we can take this equation and create a `Component` called `LengthMinusWidth`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class LengthMinusWidth(Component):

        def __init__(self):
            super(LengthMinusWidth, self).__init__()

            self.add_param('room_width', val=0.0)
            self.add_param('room_length', val=0.0)
            self.add_output('length_minus_width', val=0.0)

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            unknowns['length_minus_width'] = room_length - room_width

        def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            J = {}

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            J['length_minus_width','room_width'] = -1.0
            J['length_minus_width','room_length'] = 1.0

            return J


Deflection Component
---------------------------
Maximum deflection for a uniformly loaded beam can be calculated as

.. math::
    \delta = \frac{5 q L^4}{(E I_x 384)}

where:

- :math:`\delta` = maximum deflection (in)
- E = modulus of elasticity (constant 29000000psi for ASTM A992 Grade 50 steel)
- q = uniform load per unit length (lb/in)
- L = length of beam = room_length
- :math:`I_x` = moment of Inertia (constant 228in4 for the W8x58 beam)

q can be calculated by:

.. math::
    q = (\mathrm{tributary\_width})*(\mathrm{dead\_load} + \mathrm{live\_load}) + \mathrm{self\_weight\_of\_beam\_per\_unit\_length}

Tributary width is half the width of the room.  The live load plus the dead load is the total load.  So:

.. math::
    q = (0.5 * \mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width})  + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN}


Since George wants a deflection rating of at least L/720, our first constraint can be written as:

.. math::
    \mathrm{deflection} = \frac{L}{\delta} \geq 720

.. math::
    \mathrm{deflection} = \frac{E * I_x * 384}{5 * q * L^3} \geq 720

Substituting for `q`, and since the length of the beam is the `room_length` in our case:

.. math::
    \mathrm{deflection} = \frac{E * I_x * 384}{5 * ((0.5 * \mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width})  + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN}) * \mathrm{room\_length}^3} \geq 720
    :label: deflection

Now we can find our derivatives:

.. math::
    \frac{d \mathrm{deflection}} {d \mathrm{room\_width}} = \frac{-192 * E * I * \mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI}} {5 * \mathrm{room\_length}^3 * (\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \frac{\mathrm{room\_width}}{2} + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN)}^2}

    \frac{d \mathrm{deflection}} {d \mathrm{room\_length}} = \frac{-1152 * E * I} {5 * (\frac{\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width} }{2} + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN}) * \mathrm{room\_length}^4 }

Now we can take this equation and create a `Component` called `Deflection`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class Deflection(Component):

        def __init__(self):
            super(Deflection, self).__init__()

            self.add_param('room_width', val=0.0)
            self.add_param('room_length', val=0.0)
            self.add_output('deflection', val=0.0)

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            unknowns['deflection'] = (E * I * 384.0) / (5.0 * ((0.5 * TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width)  + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN) * room_length**3)


        def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            J = {}

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            J['deflection','room_width'] = (-192.0 * E * I * TOTAL_LOAD_PSI) / ((5.0 * room_length**3) * (TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width/2.0 + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN)**2)
            J['deflection','room_length'] = (-1152.0 * E * I) / (5.0 * ((TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width)/2.0 + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN) * room_length**4)

            return J

Bending Stress Component
----------------------------
Deflection is usually the limiting factor in beam design since designing just to the maximum load would result in an unacceptable deflection.  However, it is important to be safe by calculating the maximum bending stress of the beam.  Maximum stress in a beam with uniform load supported at both ends can be calculated as

.. math::
    \sigma = \frac{y q L^2} {8 I_x}

where:

- :math:`\sigma` = maximum stress (psi)
- y = Distance of extreme point off neutral axis (0.5*beam_height)

The maximum yield strength Fy for ASTM A992 Grade 50 steel is 50,000 psi.  George wants a safety factor of 2.0 in his design, so:

.. math::
    \mathrm{bending\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{\sigma} {\mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI}} < 0.5

Substituting for :math:`\sigma`, we get

.. math::
    \mathrm{bending\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{y * q * L^2} {8 * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI} * I_x} < 0.5

.. math::
    \mathrm{bending\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{0.5 * \mathrm{BEAM\_HEIGHT\_IN} * ((0.5 * \mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width})  + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN}) * \mathrm{room\_length}^2} {8 * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI} * I_x}
    :label: bending_stress_ratio

Now we can find our derivatives:

.. math::
    \frac{d \mathrm{bending\_stress\_ratio}} {d \mathrm{room\_width}} = \frac{\mathrm{room\_length}^2 * \mathrm{BEAM\_HEIGHT\_IN} * (\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI}*\mathrm{room\_width}/2 + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN})} {16I_x * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI}}

    \frac{d \mathrm{bending\_stress\_ratio}} {d \mathrm{room\_length}} = \frac{(\mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN} + (\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI}*\mathrm{room\_width}/2)) * \mathrm{BEAM\_HEIGHT\_IN} * \mathrm{room\_length}} {8I_x * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI}}

Now we can take this equation and create a `Component` called `BendingStress`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class BendingStress(Component):

        def __init__(self):
            super(BendingStress, self).__init__()

            self.add_param('room_width', val=0.0)
            self.add_param('room_length', val=0.0)
            self.add_output('bending_stress_ratio', val=0.0)

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            unknowns['bending_stress_ratio'] = (0.5*BEAM_HEIGHT_IN * ((0.5 * TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width)  + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN) * (room_length)**2) / (8.0 * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI * I)

        def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            J = {}

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            J['bending_stress_ratio','room_width'] = (room_length**2) * BEAM_HEIGHT_IN * (TOTAL_LOAD_PSI*room_width/2.0 + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN) / (16.0 * I * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI)
            J['bending_stress_ratio','room_length'] = (BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN + (TOTAL_LOAD_PSI*room_width/2.0)) * BEAM_HEIGHT_IN * room_length / (8.0 * I * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI)

            return J

Shear Stress Component
-------------------------------
In addition to making sure the bending stress is safe, it is also important to make sure the shear stress is safe.  According to http://www.wikiengineer.com/Structural/SteelBeamShearStrength:

    It is important to know that shear force will normally not govern over bending force, unless the member in question is very short in length, with very high loads. This is due to the fact that the bending stress will normally increase exponentially with the length of a beam while shear stress will only increase if the Force acting on the beam is increased.”

The max sheer force V in pounds for a uniformly distributed beam supported at the ends is

.. math::
    V = 0.5*\mathrm{total\_weight} = 0.5qL.

The max shear stress fv on the beam in psi is

.. math::
    f_v = \frac{V}{A}


where `A` is the cross sectional area of the beam.


The max shear stress :math:`f_v` should never exceed our maximum yield strength :math:`F_y = 50,000psi`.  However, a safety factor of 3 is recommended for sheer stress design.  Therefore, we can write:

.. math::
    \mathrm{shear\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{f_v}{F_y} < \frac{1}{3}

    \mathrm{shear\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{0.5qL}{A F_y} < \frac{1}{3}

.. math::
    \mathrm{shear\_stress\_ratio} = \frac{0.5 * ((0.5 * \mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width})  + \mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN}) * \mathrm{room\_length} }{\mathrm{CROSS\_SECTIONAL\_AREA\_SQIN} * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI}}
    :label: shear_stress_ratio

Now we can find our derivatives:

.. math::
    \frac{d \mathrm{shear\_stress\_ratio}} {d \mathrm{room\_width}} = \frac{\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_length}} {4 * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI} * \mathrm{CROSS\_SECTIONAL\_AREA\_SQIN}}

    \frac{d \mathrm{shear\_stress\_ratio}} {d \mathrm{room\_length}} = \frac{\mathrm{BEAM\_WEIGHT\_LBS\_PER\_IN} + (\mathrm{TOTAL\_LOAD\_PSI} * \mathrm{room\_width} / 2)} {2 * \mathrm{YIELD\_STRENGTH\_PSI} * \mathrm{CROSS\_SECTIONAL\_AREA\_SQIN}}

Now we can take this equation and create a `Component` called `ShearStress`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class ShearStress(Component):

        def __init__(self):
            super(ShearStress, self).__init__()

            self.add_param('room_width', val=0.0)
            self.add_param('room_length', val=0.0)
            self.add_output('shear_stress_ratio', val=0.0)

        def solve_nonlinear(self, params, unknowns, resids):

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            unknowns['shear_stress_ratio'] = 0.5 * ((0.5 * TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width)  + BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN) * (room_length) / (CROSS_SECTIONAL_AREA_SQIN * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI)

        def linearize(self, params, unknowns, resids):
            J = {}

            room_width = params['room_width']
            room_length = params['room_length']

            J['shear_stress_ratio','room_width'] = TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_length / (4.0 * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI * CROSS_SECTIONAL_AREA_SQIN)
            J['shear_stress_ratio','room_length'] = (BEAM_WEIGHT_LBS_PER_IN + (TOTAL_LOAD_PSI * room_width / 2.0))/(2.0 * YIELD_STRENGTH_PSI * CROSS_SECTIONAL_AREA_SQIN)

            return J



Putting it all Together
-------------------------------

First we must take all five of our `Components` and combine them into a `Group`.  The design variables `room_length` and `room_width` must be created as `IndepVarComp`, and they are initialized to 100 inches as a best guess.  Then, we connnect the design variables to the inputs of the five `Components`.

.. testcode:: Beam

    class BeamTutorial(Group):

        def __init__(self):
            super(BeamTutorial, self).__init__()

            #add design variables or IndepVarComp's
            self.add('ivc_rlength', IndepVarComp('room_length', 100.0))
            self.add('ivc_rwidth', IndepVarComp('room_width', 100.0))

            #add our custom components
            self.add('d_len_minus_wid', LengthMinusWidth())
            self.add('d_deflection', Deflection())
            self.add('d_bending', BendingStress())
            self.add('d_shear', ShearStress())
            self.add('d_neg_area', NegativeArea())

            #make connections from design variables to the Components
            self.connect('ivc_rlength.room_length','d_len_minus_wid.room_length')
            self.connect('ivc_rwidth.room_width','d_len_minus_wid.room_width')

            self.connect('ivc_rlength.room_length','d_deflection.room_length')
            self.connect('ivc_rwidth.room_width','d_deflection.room_width')

            self.connect('ivc_rlength.room_length','d_bending.room_length')
            self.connect('ivc_rwidth.room_width','d_bending.room_width')

            self.connect('ivc_rlength.room_length','d_shear.room_length')
            self.connect('ivc_rwidth.room_width','d_shear.room_width')

            self.connect('ivc_rlength.room_length','d_neg_area.room_length')
            self.connect('ivc_rwidth.room_width','d_neg_area.room_width')

Finally, we set up the problem.  We bound `room_length` to only be between 5ft and 50ft, and `room_width` to be between 5ft and 30ft.  We set our minimization objective to `neg_room_area`.  Then we constrain the outputs from our Components.

    print( "Finished!")


Output
-------------------------------

    Solution found

    room area: 51655.257618 in^2 (358.717067 ft^2)

    room width: 227.277956 in (18.939830 ft)

    room/beam length: 227.277904 in (18.939825 ft)

    deflection: L/719.999555

    bending stress ratio: 0.148863

    shear stress ratio: 0.007985

    loading (including self weight of beam): 60.074503pli 720.894039plf

    loading (not including self weight of beam): 55.241170pli 662.894039plf

The solution indicates that the optimum room size is about 19ft by 19ft (using a 19ft beam), which is about 359 sq ft.  The fact that the room is square makes some sense since squares are more efficient at yielding more area than rectangles.  It is clear that deflection was the limiting component at the limit of L/720.  The bending stress ratio was not limiting (0.149 < 0.5).  The shear stress ratio was not limiting (0.008 < 0.33).
