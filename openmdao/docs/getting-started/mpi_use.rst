Using MPI in OpenMDAO
---------------------

There are a number of ways to use MPI in OpenMDAO.  In The
`Distributed Adder Example`_ you'll see how to build your own distributed
components in OpenMDAO.  In the `Parallel Multi Point Example`_ you'll see how
to use OpenMDAO to build a multi-point problem to analyze a single design at a
number of different conditions in parallel. In
:ref:`Parallel Finite Difference <parallel_finite_difference>` you'll learn
how to perform finite difference evaluations in parallel.  Finally,
:ref:`Running a DOE Driver in Parallel <doe_driver_parallel>` describes how
to run multiple DOE cases in parallel.
